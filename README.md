## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Images have a default value of `display: inline;`, so if you put an image inside a container, it will show a small margin under itself, preventing it from fitting perfectly into its container. To avoid this issue you can set the display property to `block`.

```html
<div class="image-container">
  <img class="image" src="image.png" alt="image description">
</div>
```
```css
/* Reset */

img{
  display: block;
}

/* Layout */

.image-container {
  width: 20rem;
}

.image{
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

Improving at using semantic HTML tags and creating more accesible components
